Powershell prompt clearing based on the terminal size

Get-Host.UI.RawUI.WindoSize.Width or something check the docs

last time log :- 
This project is postponed for future
This grew to be more complex using .net apis and windows stuff 
and combining with powershell since probably there is no way 
to powershell to reacto to window resizing events
